# ThreadPool

The ThreadPool library is a simple and efficient way to manage multiple tasks in a program. It allows you to run several tasks at the same time using a pool of worker threads. This can help improve the performance of your program, especially when dealing with many tasks that can be executed concurrently.

To build and install the library, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the ```LibThreadPool``` directory.
- Create a build directory and navigate into it.
- Run ```cmake ..``` to configure the build.
- Run ```make``` to compile the library.
- Run ```sudo make install``` to install the library.

To test the library:

- Navigate to the ```LibThreadPool/test``` directory.
- Create a build directory and navigate into it.
- Run ```cmake ..``` to configure the test build.
- Run ```make``` to compile the test.
- Run ```./test``` to execute the test.
